# ho-style-prototype-kit
GOV.UK Prototype Kit - with Home Office styles
This prototype relies on an older node 11. In order to revert to this older node version you must
download a node version manager which will allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system.
From your clone of the current kit, you may need these commands
- nvm use v11
- npm install
- npm start
